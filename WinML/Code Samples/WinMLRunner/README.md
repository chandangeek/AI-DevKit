# WinMLRunner tool

The WinMLRunner is a command-line based tool that can run .onnx or .pb models where the input and output variables are tensors or images. It will attempt to load, bind, and evaluate a model and output error messages if these steps were unsuccessful. It will also capture performance measurements on the GPU and/or CPU. If using the performance flag, the GPU, CPU and wall-clock times for loading, binding, and evaluating and the CPU and GPU memory usage during evaluation will print to the command line and to a CSV file.

## Getting the tool

You can either download the x64 executable or build it yourself.

### Download

[Download x64 Exe](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Machine-Learning/releases/tag/v1.0.0.0)

### Build

#### Prerequisites
- [Visual Studio 2017 Version 15.7.4 or Newer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads)
- [Windows 10 - Build 17763 or higher](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewiso)
- [Windows SDK - Build 17763 or higher](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewSDK)

The easiest way to use these samples without using Git is to download the zip file containing the current version (using the following link or by clicking the "Download ZIP" button on the repo page). You can then unzip the entire archive and use the samples in Visual Studio 2017. Notes: Before you unzip the archive, right-click it, select Properties, and then select Unblock.
Be sure to unzip the entire archive, and not just individual samples. The samples all depend on the SharedContent folder in the archive. In Visual Studio 2017, the platform target defaults to ARM, so be sure to change that to x64 or x86 if you want to test on a non-ARM device. Reminder: If you unzip individual samples, they will not build due to references to other portions of the ZIP file that were not unzipped. 
You must unzip the entire archive if you intend to build the samples.

## Run the tool
 ```
Required command-Line arguments:
-model <path>            : Fully qualified path to a .onnx or .pb model file.
      or
-folder <path>           : Fully qualifed path to a folder with .onnx and/or .pb models, will run all of the models in the folder.

#Optional command-line arguments:
-version: prints the version information for this build of WinMLRunner.exe
-CPU : run model on default CPU
-GPU : run model on default GPU
-GPUHighPerformance : run model on GPU with highest performance
-GPUMinPower : run model on GPU with the least power
-CreateDeviceOnClient : create the device on the client and pass it to WinML
-CreateDeviceInWinML : create the device inside WinML
-CPUBoundInput : bind the input to the CPU
-GPUBoundInput : bind the input to the GPU
-RGB : load the input as an RGB image
-BGR : load the input as a BGR image
-Tensor : load the input as a tensor
-Perf [all]: capture performance measurements such as timing and memory usage. Specifying "all" will output all measurements
-Iterations : # times perf measurements will be run/averaged
-Input <fully qualified path>: binds image or CSV to model
-TopK <number>: print top <number> values in the result. Default to 1
-PerfOutput [<fully qualified path>]: csv file to write the perf results to
-SavePerIterationPerf : save per iteration performance results to csv file
-SaveTensorData <saveMode folderPath>: saveMode: save first iteration or all iteration output tensor results to csv file [First, All]
                                        folderPath: Optional folder path can be specified to hold tensor data. It will be created if folder doesn't exist.
-DebugEvaluate: Print evaluation debug output to debug console if debugger is present.
-Terse: Terse Mode (suppresses repetitive console output)
-AutoScale <interpolationMode>: Enable image autoscaling and set the interpolation mode [Nearest, Linear, Cubic, Fant]

Concurrency Options:
-ConcurrentLoad: load models concurrently
-NumThreads <number>: number of threads to load a model. By default this will be the number of model files to be executed
-ThreadInterval <milliseconds>: interval time between two thread creations in milliseconds

 ```

Note that -CPU, -GPU, -GPUHighPerformance, -GPUMinPower -BGR, -RGB, -tensor, -CPUBoundInput, -GPUBoundInput are not mutually exclusive (i.e. you can combine as many as you want to run the model with different configurations).

### Examples:
Run a model on the CPU and GPU separately 5 times and output performance data:
> WinMLRunner.exe -model c:\\data\\concat.onnx -iterations 5 -perf

Runs all the models in the data folder, captures performance data 3 times using only the CPU: 
> WinMLRunner.exe -folder c:\\data -perf -iterations 3 -CPU

Run a model on the CPU and GPU separately, and by binding the input to the CPU and the GPU separately (4 total runs):
> WinMLRunner.exe -model c:\\data\\SqueezeNet.onnx -CPU -GPU -CPUBoundInput -GPUBoundInput

Run a model on the CPU with the input bound to the GPU and loaded as an RGB image:
> WinMLRunner.exe -model c:\\data\\SqueezeNet.onnx -CPU -GPUBoundInput -RGB

## Performance output
The following performance measurements will be output to the command-line and .csv file for each load, bind, and evaluate operation:

* **Wall-clock time**: the elapsed real time (in ms) between the beginning and end of an operation.
* **GPU time**: time (in ms) for an operation to be passed from CPU to GPU and execute on the GPU (note: Load() is not executed on the GPU).
* **CPU time**: time (in ms) for an operation to execute on the CPU.

If capturing performance measurements, the program will create a CSV titled "WinML Model Run [Today's date]" in the same folder as the .exe file. 
 ```
Working Set Memory (MB) - The amount of DRAM memory that the process on the CPU required during evaluation.
Dedicated Memory (MB) - The amount of memory that was used on the VRAM of the dedicated GPU.

 ## Capturing Trace Logs
 If you want to capture trace logs using the tool, you can use logman commands in conjunction with the debug flag:
 ```
logman start winml -ets -o winmllog.etl -nb 128 640 -bs 128
logman update trace  winml -p {BCAD6AEE-C08D-4F66-828C-4C43461A033D} 0xffffffffffffffff 0xff -ets         
WinMLRunner.exe -model C:\Repos\Windows-Machine-Learning\SharedContent\models\SqueezeNet.onnx -debug
logman stop winml -ets
 ```
The winmllog.etl file will appear in the same directory as the WinMLRunner.exe. 
 
 ## Reading the Trace Logs
1. Using the traceprt.exe
  * Run the following command from the command-line and open the logdump.csv file:
 ```
tracerpt.exe winmllog.etl -o logdump.csv -of CSV
 ```

2. Windows Performance Analyzer (from Visual Studio)
 * Launch Windows Performance Analyzer and open the winmllog.etl.

## Dynamic DLL Loading

If you want to run WinMLRunner with another version of WinML (e.g. comparing the performance with an older version or testing a newer version), simply place the `windows.ai.machinelearning.dll` and `directml.dll` files in the same folder as WinMLRunner.exe. WinMLRunner will look for for these DLLs first and fall back to `C:/Windows/System32` if it doesn't find them.

## Known issues

- Sequence/Map inputs are not supported yet (the model is just skipped, so it doesn't block other models in a folder);
- We cannot reliably run multiple models with the `-folder` argument with real data. Since we can only specify 1 input, the size of the input would mismatch with most of the models. Right now, using the `-folder` argument only works well with garbage data;
- Generating garbage input as Gray or YUV is not currently supported. Ideally, WinMLRunner's garbage data pipeline should support all inputs types that we can give to winml.
